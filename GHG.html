        <h2>Data on Emissions</h2>
        <p><strong>Carbon dioxide (CO2):</strong> 
Fossil fuel use is the primary source of CO2.
CO2 can also be emitted from the landscape through deforestation, land clearance for agriculture or development, and degradation of soils. 
Likewise, land management can also remove additional CO2 from the atmosphere through reforestation, improvement of soil health, and other activities.
<br><strong>Methane (CH4): </strong>Agricultural activities, waste management, energy production and use, and biomass burning all contribute to CH4 emissions.
<br><strong>Nitrous oxide (N2O):</strong> Agricultural activities, such as fertilizer use, are the primary source of N2O emissions.
Chemical production and fossil fuel combustion also generates N2O.
<br><strong>Fluorinated gases (F-gases):</strong>  Industrial processes, refrigeration, and the use of a variety of consumer products contribute to emissions of F-gases,
which include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).

<pre><strong>Source:</strong> Data from IPCC (2022); Based on global emissions from 2019, details on the sectors and individual contributing sources can be found in the Contribution of Working
 Group III to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Mitigation of Climate Change, Chapter 2.<br></pre>
<strong>Electricity and Heat Production (34% of 2019 global greenhouse gas emissions):</strong> 
 The burning of coal, natural gas, and oil for electricity and heat is the largest single source of global greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
<strong> Industry (24% of 2019 global greenhouse gas emissions):</strong>
Greenhouse gas emissions from industry primarily involve fossil fuels burned on site at facilities for energy.
 This sector also includes emissions from chemical, metallurgical, and mineral transformation processes not associated with energy consumption and emissions from waste management activities.
  (Note: Emissions from industrial electricity use are excluded and are instead covered in the Electricity and Heat Production sector.)
<br><strong>Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (22% of 2019 global greenhouse gas emissions):</strong>
 Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector come mostly from agriculture (cultivation of crops and livestock)and deforestation.
 This estimate does not include the CO2 that ecosystems remove from the atmosphere by sequestering carbon (e.g. in biomass, soils).<br>

<strong>Transportation (15% of 2019 global greenhouse gas emissions):</strong>
 Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector primarily involve fossil fuels burnedfor road, rail, air, and marine transportation.
 Almost all (95%) of the world's transportation energy comes from petroleum-based fuels, largely gasoline and diesel.[3]
<br><strong>Buildings (6% of 2019 global greenhouse gas emissions):</strong> 
 Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector arise from onsite energy generation and burning fuels for heat in buildings or cooking in homes.
 Note: Emissions from this sector are 16% when electricity use in buildings is included in this sector instead of the Energy sector.
Emissions by Country
GHG Emissions by Country in 2020
<img src="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/styles/huge/private/images/2023-08/Fig-4-Country-GHG-Emissions_Scaled-Down.png?itok=jA3jPhuF">
<pre>Source: Data from Climate Watch; Climate Watch Historical GHG Emissions (1990-2020). 2023. Washington, DC: World Resources Institute. Available online at: https://www.climatewatchdata.org/ghg-emissions
In 2020, the top ten greenhouse gas emitters were China, the United States, India, the European Union, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan, Iran, and Canada.
These data include CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorinated gas emissions from energy, agriculture, forestry and land use change, industry, and waste. Together, these top ten countries represent approximately
67% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.</pre>

Emissions and sinks related to changes in land use are not included in these estimates. However, changes in land use can be important: estimates indicate that net global greenhouse gas emissions 
from agriculture, forestry, and other land use were approximately 12 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent,[2] or about 21% of total global greenhouse gas emissions
[3] In areas such as the United States and Europe, changes in land use associated with human activities have the net effect of absorbing CO2, partially offsetting the emissions from deforestation in other regions.

        <h2>Impact of Emissions</h2>
        <p><strong>Information on climate change, health, and biodiversity impacts.</strong> <br>
            The emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has wide-ranging effects on climate change, human health, and biodiversity. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of these impacts:
            <br> <mark>Climate Change</mark>
            <br><strong>Global Warming:</strong><br>

 GHGs, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming.
 This warming alters weather patterns, increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and contributes to rising sea levels.

<strong>Acidification:</strong> 
 Increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere also lead to higher CO2 concentrations in oceans, causing ocean acidification.
 This affects marine life, particularly organisms like coral reefs and shellfish, which rely on calcium carbonate for their skeletal structures.

 <br>
 <mark>Health Impacts </mark><br>
<strong>

Air Quality:</strong>
GHGs often accompany pollutants that can deteriorate air quality, such as particulate matter and ozone. Poor air quality is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, among other health problems.
Heatwaves and Weather Extremes: As global temperatures rise, heatwaves become more frequent and severe, leading to heat-related illnesses and deaths. Extreme weather events like hurricanes and floods can also have 
direct health impacts, including injuries and increased risks of waterborne diseases.<img src="https://www.aqi.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Top20-worlds-most-polluted-countries-avg.-AQI-2022-1-1024x633.jpg"><br>



<strong>Vector-Borne Diseases:</strong>
Changes in climate can expand the range and season of pests like mosquitoes and ticks, increasing the spread of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease.
<br>
<mark>
    Biodiversity
</mark><strong>
    <br>Habitat Alteration:</strong>
Climate change alters the natural habitats of countless species, forcing them to migrate to cooler or more suitable areas, which can lead to decreased biodiversity.
Some species may not be able to adapt or migrate quickly enough, leading to extinction.
Phenological Changes:
Changes in the timing of natural events, like flowering and migration, disrupt the interconnectedness of ecosystems.
For example, if plants bloom earlier than usual, the species that rely on them for food during specific periods may suffer.
Ocean Impacts:
Ocean acidification and warming affect marine ecosystems profoundly. Coral bleaching, a stress response to warm water temperatures, can lead to the collapse of coral reef ecosystems,
which are vital for marine biodiversity.
